- 💻 If you want the dislike button back on youtube, here. You're welcome. UserScript is available at https://www.returnyoutubedislike.com/
- What's that? WWhy use a UserScript for Safari and not a Chrome Extension? Because 4KHDR looks better on Safari, that's why. Plus, I like my RAM where I can see it.
